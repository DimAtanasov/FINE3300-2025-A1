FINE3300 - Assignment 1 - By Dimitar Atanasov

For this assignment, I created a GitHub repository and wrote Python code that calculates mortgage payments and converts between CAD and USD using the latest Bank of Canada exchange rates. The program also goes a step further and validates user inputs to make sure only valid numbers and currencies are entered.
